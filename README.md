This app bridges that gap by using computer vision and machine learning to automatically read and identify medications from presciption images.

## Features
- Camera Integrations - Captur presciption images directly from your phone
- OCR Processing - Extract text from handwritten prescription
- Machine Learning - Trained on IAM handwriting dataset
- Android Native

## Technology Used
#### Android Application
- Java
- Android Studio

#### Machine Learning Pipeline
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV

## Future Enhancement
- [ ] Improve the medicine name mapping accuracy
- [ ] Medicine interaction warnings
- [ ] Possible Medicine usecase
- [ ] Integration with pharmacy databases
- [ ] Dosage and instruction extraction
